Homie:
- refactor color handling
- Use ValueParser
- Do NOT retain messages for non-getable capabilities (button)
- Introduce queue for updating device state (use brightness slider ha app)
- Device Aliasses (e.g. dim/brightness, light temperature, etc.)

- Fix RGB
- (listen to) broadcasts
- Zone depth > 1 (folder structure)

App:
- [BUG] disabling devices it removed them from the homie/homey topic tree but created another named literally homie/deviceID
- [Check] Refresh devices on device/zone changes + Broadcast
- Translate to Dutch
- Translate to German

MQTT Device:
- default percentage scaling + example value templates: value / 100 & value * 100
- fetch retained value when configuring topics
- Handle (un)installing of MQTT app
- availablility topic
- Translations
- auto detect on/off values (setting) from state topic
- auto fill set topic while typing state topic
- Color (+ device setting)

Discovery (auto discover external devices):
! [Check] Capability matches Nefit
- Detect already configured devices & mark them created
- Implement HA discovery
- Keep a record of previous discovery topic

Commands:
- Updating state for multiple devices (e.g. all devices in a room) == Homie broadcast?
- Trigger flow
- Info requests:
  * System
  * Device classes
  * Zones
  * ...
- Listen to scene flow triggers

Insights / System info:
- Publish system info on seperate topics (i.s.o. json)
- updates per 1, 5 & 15 minutes
- (All) Prometheus functionality
